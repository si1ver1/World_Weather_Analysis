# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
### Part 1: Retrieve Weather Data
We will generate 2000 random coordinates and use these to create a csv dataset with the city name, country code, lalitude, longitude, max temperature, clodiness, wind speed, and current weather description.

### Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Using our dataset we will allow users to search for a temperature range and map out potential destinations (including hotels) for places that fit their specifications.

### Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
In the final part we build a travel iterary based on 4 locations which includes a google maps transit view and a google maps overview of the locations, hotel, and temperature.
